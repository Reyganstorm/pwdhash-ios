# Stanford PwdHash for iOS

PwdHash generates theft-resistant passwords. This app transparently produces a different password for each site, improving web password security and defending against password phishing and other attack.

The algorithm is completely the same as the one on the PwdHash [website](http://pwdhash.com).
